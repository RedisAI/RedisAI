# RedisAI Commands
RedisAI is a Redis module, and as such it implements several data types and the respective commands to use them.

All of RedisAI's commands begin with the `AI.` prefix. The following sections describe these commands.

**Syntax Conventions**

The following conventions are used for describing the RedisAI Redis API:

* `COMMAND`: a command or an argument name
* `<mandatory>`: a mandatory argument
* `[optional]`: an optional argument
* `"`: a literal double quote character
* `|`: an exclusive logical or operator
* `...`: more of the same as before

## AI.TENSORSET
The **`AI.TENSORSET`** command stores a tensor as the value of a key.

**Redis API**

```
AI.TENSORSET <key> <type>
   <shape> [shape ...] [BLOB <data> | VALUES <val> [val ...]]
```

_Arguments_

* **key**: the tensor's key name
* **type**: the tensor's data type can be one of: `FLOAT`, `DOUBLE`, `INT8`, `INT16`, `INT32`, `INT64`, `UINT8` or `UINT16`
* **shape**: one or more dimensions, or the number of elements per axis, for the tensor
* **BLOB**: indicates that data is in binary format and is provided via the subsequent `data` argument
* **VALUES**: indicates that data is numeric and is provided by one or more subsequent `val` arguments

_Return_

A simple 'OK' string or an error.

**Examples**

Given the following: $\begin{equation*} A = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 \\ 3 & 4 \\ \end{bmatrix} \end{equation*}$

This will set the key 'mytensor' to the 2x2 RedisAI tensor:

```
redis> AI.TENSORSET mytensor FLOAT 2 2 VALUES 1 2 3 4
OK
```

!!! note "Uninitialized Tensor Values"
    As both `BLOB` and `VALUES` are optional arguments, it is possible to use the `AI.TENSORSET` to create an uninitialized tensor.

!!! important "Using `BLOB` is preferable to `VALUES`"
    While it is possible to set the tensor using binary data or numerical values, it is recommended that you use the `BLOB` option. It requires fewer resources and performs better compared to specifying the values discretely.

## AI.TENSORGET
The **`AI.TENSORGET`** command returns a tensor stored as key's value.

**Redis API**

```
AI.TENSORGET <key> [META] [format]
```

_Arguments_

* **key**: the tensor's key name
* **META**: returns the tensor's metadata
* **format**: the tensor's reply format can be one of the following:
    * **BLOB**: returns the binary representation of the tensor's data
    * **VALUES**: returns the numerical representation of the tensor's data

_Return_

Depending on the specified reply format:

 * **META**: Array containing the tensor's metadata exclusively. The returned array consists of the following elements:
    1. The tensor's data type as a String
    1. The tensor's shape as an Array consisting of an item per dimension
 * **BLOB**: the tensor's binary data as a String. If used together with the **META** option, the binary data string will put after the metadata in the array reply.
 * **VALUES**: Array containing the numerical representation of the tensor's data. If used together with the **META** option, the binary data string will put after the metadata in the array reply.



**Examples**

Given a tensor value stored at the 'mytensor' key:

```
redis> AI.TENSORSET mytensor FLOAT 2 2 VALUES 1 2 3 4
OK
```

The following shows how to retrieve the tensor's metadata:

```
redis> AI.TENSORGET mytensor META
1) "dtype"
2) "FLOAT"
3) "shape"
4) 1) (integer) 2
   2) (integer) 2
```

The following shows how to retrieve the tensor's values as an Array:

```
redis> AI.TENSORGET mytensor VALUES
1) "1"
2) "2"
3) "3"
4) "4"
```

The following shows how to retrieve the tensor's binary data as a String:

```
redis> AI.TENSORGET mytensor BLOB
"\x00\x00\x80?\x00\x00\x00@\x00\x00@@\x00\x00\x80@"
```


The following shows how the combine the retrieval of the tensor's metadata, and the tensor's values as an Array:

```
redis> AI.TENSORGET mytensor META VALUES
1) "dtype"
2) "FLOAT"
3) "shape"
4) 1) (integer) 2
   2) (integer) 2
5) "values"
6) 1) "1"
   2) "2"
   3) "3"
   4) "4"
```

The following shows how the combine the retrieval of the tensor's metadata, and binary data as a String:

```
redis> AI.TENSORGET mytensor META BLOB
1) "dtype"
2) "FLOAT"
3) "shape"
4) 1) (integer) 2
   2) (integer) 2
5) "blob"
6) "\x00\x00\x80?\x00\x00\x00@\x00\x00@@\x00\x00\x80@"
```

!!! important "Using `BLOB` is preferable to `VALUES`"
    While it is possible to get the tensor as binary data or numerical values, it is recommended that you use the `BLOB` option. It requires fewer resources and performs better compared to returning the values discretely.

## AI.MODELSET
The **`AI.MODELSET`** commands stores a model as the value of a key.

**Redis API**

```
AI.MODELSET <key> <backend> <device>
    [TAG tag] [BATCHSIZE n [MINBATCHSIZE m]]
    [INPUTS <name> ...] [OUTPUTS name ...] BLOB <model>
```

_Arguments_

* **key**: the model's key name
* **backend**: the backend for the model can be one of:
    * **TF**: a TensorFlow backend
    * **TFLITE**: The TensorFlow Lite backend
    * **TORCH**: a PyTorch backend
    * **ONNX**: a ONNX backend
* **device**: the device that will execute the model can be of:
    * **CPU**: a CPU device
    * **GPU**: a GPU device
    * **GPU:0**, ..., **GPU:n**: a specific GPU device on a multi-GPU system
* **TAG**: an optional string for tagging the model such as a version number or any arbitrary identifier
* **BATCHSIZE**: when provided with an `n` that is greater than 0, the engine will batch incoming requests from multiple clients that use the model with input tensors of the same shape. When `AI.MODELRUN` is called the requests queue is visited and input tensors from compatible requests are concatenated along the 0th (batch) dimension until `n` is exceeded. The model is then run for the entire batch and the results are unpacked back to the individual requests unblocking their respective clients. If the batch size of the inputs to of first request in the queue exceeds `BATCHSIZE`, the request is served immediately (default value: 0).
* **MINBATCHSIZE**: when provided with an `m` that is greater than 0, the engine will postpone calls to `AI.MODELRUN` until the batch's size had reached `m`. This is primarily used to force batching during testing, but it can also be used under normal operation. In this case, note that requests for which `m` is not reached will hang indefinitely (default value: 0).
* **INPUTS**: one or more names of the model's input nodes (applicable only for TensorFlow models)
* **OUTPUTS**: one or more names of the model's output nodes (applicable only for TensorFlow models)
* **model**: the Protobuf-serialized model. Since Redis supports strings up to 512MB, blobs for very large models need to be chunked, e.g. `BLOB chunk1 chunk2 ...`.

_Return_

A simple 'OK' string or an error.

**Examples**

This example shows to set a model 'mymodel' key using the contents of a local file with [`redis-cli`](https://redis.io/topics/cli). Refer to the [Clients Page](clients.md) for additional client choices that are native to your programming language:

```
$ cat resnet50.pb | redis-cli -x AI.MODELSET mymodel TF CPU TAG imagenet:5.0 INPUTS images OUTPUTS output BLOB
OK
```

## AI.MODELGET
The **`AI.MODELGET`** command returns a model's metadata and blob stored as a key's value.

**Redis API**

```
AI.MODELGET <key> [META] [BLOB]
```

_Arguments

* **key**: the model's key name
* **META**: will return the model's meta information on backend, device and tag
* **BLOB**: will return the model's blob containing the serialized model

_Return_

An array of alternating key-value pairs as follows:

1. **BACKEND**: the backend used by the model as a String
1. **DEVICE**: the device used to execute the model as a String
1. **TAG**: the model's tag as a String
1. **BATCHSIZE**: The maximum size of any batch of incoming requests. If `BATCHSIZE` is equal to 0 each incoming request is served immediately. When `BATCHSIZE` is greater than 0, the engine will batch incoming requests from multiple clients that use the model with input tensors of the same shape.
1. **MINBATCHSIZE**: The minimum size of any batch of incoming requests.
1. **INPUTS**: array reply with one or more names of the model's input nodes (applicable only for TensorFlow models)
1. **OUTPUTS**: array reply with one or more names of the model's output nodes (applicable only for TensorFlow models)
1. **BLOB**: a blob containing the serialized model (when called with the `BLOB` argument) as a String. If the size of the serialized model exceeds `MODEL_CHUNK_SIZE` (see `AI.CONFIG` command), then an array of chunks is returned. The full serialized model can be obtained by concatenating the chunks.

**Examples**

Assuming that your model is stored under the 'mymodel' key, you can obtain its metadata with:

```
redis> AI.MODELGET mymodel META
 1) "backend"
 2) "TF"
 3) "device"
 4) "CPU"
 5) "tag"
 6) "imagenet:5.0"
 7) "batchsize"
 8) (integer) 0
 9) "minbatchsize"
10) (integer) 0
11) "inputs"
12) 1) "a"
    2) "b"
13) "outputs"
14) 1) "c"
```

You can also save it to the local file 'model.ext' with [`redis-cli`](https://redis.io/topics/cli) like so:

```
$ redis-cli --raw AI.MODELGET mymodel BLOB > model.ext
```

## AI.MODELDEL
The **`AI.MODELDEL`** deletes a model stored as a key's value.

**Redis API**

```
AI.MODELDEL <key>
```

_Arguments_

* **key**: the model's key name

_Return_

A simple 'OK' string or an error.

**Examples**

Assuming that your model is stored under the 'mymodel' key, you can delete it like this:

```
redis> AI.MODELDEL mymodel
OK
```

!!! note "The `AI.MODELDEL` vis a vis the `DEL` command"
    The `AI.MODELDEL` is equivalent to the [Redis `DEL` command](https://redis.io/commands/del) and should be used in its stead. This ensures compatibility with all deployment options (i.e., stand-alone vs. cluster, OSS vs. Enterprise).

## AI.MODELRUN
The **`AI.MODELRUN`** command runs a model stored as a key's value using its specified backend and device. It accepts one or more input tensors and store output tensors.

The run request is put in a queue and is executed asynchronously by a worker thread. The client that had issued the run request is blocked until the model's run is completed. When needed, tensors' data is automatically copied to the device prior to execution.

!!! warning "Intermediate memory overhead"
    The execution of models will generate intermediate tensors that are not allocated by the Redis allocator, but by whatever allocator is used in the backends (which may act on main memory or GPU memory, depending on the device), thus not being limited by `maxmemory` configuration settings of Redis.

**Redis API**

```
AI.MODELRUN <key> INPUTS <input> [input ...] OUTPUTS <output> [output ...]
```

_Arguments_

* **key**: the model's key name
* **INPUTS**: denotes the beginning of the input tensors keys' list, followed by one or more key names
* **OUTPUTS**: denotes the beginning of the output tensors keys' list, followed by one or more key names

_Return_

A simple 'OK' string or an error.

**Examples**

Assuming that running the model that's stored at 'mymodel' with the tensor 'mytensor' as input outputs two tensors - 'classes' and 'predictions', the following command does that:

```
redis> AI.MODELRUN mymodel INPUTS mytensor OUTPUTS classes predictions
OK
```

## AI._MODELSCAN
The **AI._MODELSCAN** command returns all the models in the database.

!!! warning "Experimental API"
    `AI._MODELSCAN` is an EXPERIMENTAL command that may be removed in future versions.

**Redis API**

```
AI._MODELSCAN
```

_Arguments_

None.

_Return_

An array with an entry per model. Each entry is an array with two entries:

1. The model's key name as a String
1. The model's tag as a String

**Examples**

```
redis> > AI._MODELSCAN
1) 1) "mymodel"
   2) imagenet:5.0
```

## AI.SCRIPTSET
The **`AI.SCRIPTSET`** command stores a [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) as the value of a key.

**Redis API**

```
AI.SCRIPTSET <key> <device> [TAG tag] SOURCE "<script>"
```

_Arguments_


* **key**: the script's key name
* **TAG**: an optional string for tagging the script such as a version number or any arbitrary identifier
* **device**: the device that will execute the model can be of:
    * **CPU**: a CPU device
    * **GPU**: a GPU device
    * **GPU:0**, ..., **GPU:n**: a specific GPU device on a multi-GPU system
* **script**: a string containing [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) source code

_Return_

A simple 'OK' string or an error.

**Examples**

Given the following contents of the file 'addtwo.py':

```python
def addtwo(a, b):
    return a + b
```

It can be stored as a RedisAI script using the CPU device with [`redis-cli`](https://redis.io/topics/rediscli) as follows:

```
$ cat addtwo.py | redis-cli -x AI.SCRIPTSET myscript addtwo CPU TAG myscript:v0.1 SOURCE
OK
```

## AI.SCRIPTGET
The **`AI.SCRIPTGET`** command returns the [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) stored as a key's value.

**Redis API**

Get script metadata and source.

```
AI.SCRIPTGET <key> [META] [SOURCE]
```

_Arguments_

* **key**: the script's key name
* **META**: will return the script's meta information on device and tag
* **SOURCE**: will return a string containing [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) source code

_Return_

An array with alternating entries that represent the following key-value pairs:
!!!!The command returns a list of key-value strings, namely `DEVICE device TAG tag [SOURCE source]`.

1. **DEVICE**: the script's device as a String
1. **TAG**: the scripts's tag as a String
1. **SOURCE**: the script's source code as a String

**Examples**

The following shows how to read the script stored at the 'myscript' key:

```
redis> AI.SCRIPTGET myscript
1) "device"
2) CPU
3) "tag"
4) "myscript:v0.1"
5) "source"
6) def addtwo(a, b):
    return a + b
```

## AI.SCRIPTDEL
The **`AI.SCRIPTDEL`** deletes a script stored as a key's value.

**Redis API**

```
AI.SCRIPTDEL <key>
```

_Arguments_

* **key**: the script's key name

_Return_

A simple 'OK' string or an error.

**Examples**

```
redis> AI.SCRIPTDEL myscript
OK
```

!!! note "The `AI.SCRIPTDEL` vis a vis the `DEL` command"
    The `AI.SCRIPTDEL` is equivalent to the [Redis `DEL` command](https://redis.io/commands/del) and should be used in its stead. This ensures compatibility with all deployment options (i.e., stand-alone vs. cluster, OSS vs. Enterprise).


## AI.SCRIPTRUN
The **`AI.SCRIPTRUN`** command runs a script stored as a key's value on its specified device. It accepts one or more input tensors and store output tensors.

**Redis API**

```
AI.SCRIPTRUN <key> <function> INPUTS <input> [input ...] [$ input ...] OUTPUTS <output> [output ...]
```

_Arguments_

* **key**: the script's key name
* **function**: the name of the function to run
* **INPUTS**: denotes the beginning of the input tensors keys' list, followed by one or more key names;
              variadic arguments are supported by prepending the list with `$`, in this case the
              script is expected an argument of type `List[Tensor]` as its last argument
* **OUTPUTS**: denotes the beginning of the output tensors keys' list, followed by one or more key names

_Return_

A simple 'OK' string or an error.

**Examples**

The following is an example of running the previously-created 'myscript' on two input tensors:

```
redis> AI.TENSORSET mytensor1 FLOAT 1 VALUES 40
OK
redis> AI.TENSORSET mytensor2 FLOAT 1 VALUES 2
OK
redis> AI.SCRIPTRUN myscript addtwo INPUTS mytensor1 mytensor2 OUTPUTS result
OK
redis> AI.TENSORGET result VALUES
1) FLOAT
2) 1) (integer) 1
3) 1) "42"
```

If 'myscript' supports variadic arguments:
```python
def addn(a, args : List[Tensor]):
    return a + torch.stack(args).sum()
```

then one can provide an arbitrary number of inputs after the `$` sign:

```
redis> AI.TENSORSET mytensor1 FLOAT 1 VALUES 40
OK
redis> AI.TENSORSET mytensor2 FLOAT 1 VALUES 1
OK
redis> AI.TENSORSET mytensor3 FLOAT 1 VALUES 1
OK
redis> AI.SCRIPTRUN myscript addn INPUTS mytensor1 $ mytensor2 mytensor3 OUTPUTS result
OK
redis> AI.TENSORGET result VALUES
1) FLOAT
2) 1) (integer) 1
3) 1) "42"
```

!!! warning "Intermediate memory overhead"
    The execution of scripts may generate intermediate tensors that are not allocated by the Redis allocator, but by whatever allocator is used in the backends (which may act on main memory or GPU memory, depending on the device), thus not being limited by `maxmemory` configuration settings of Redis.

## AI._SCRIPTSCAN
The **AI._SCRIPTSCAN** command returns all the scripts in the database.

!!! warning "Experimental API"
    `AI._SCRIPTSCAN` is an EXPERIMENTAL command that may be removed in future versions.

**Redis API**

```
AI._SCRIPTSCAN
```

_Arguments_

None.

_Return_

An array with an entry per script. Each entry is an array with two entries:

1. The script's key name as a String
1. The script's tag as a String

**Examples**

```
redis> > AI._SCRIPTSCAN
1) 1) "myscript"
   2) "myscript:v0.1"
```

## AI.DAGRUN
The **`AI.DAGRUN`** command specifies a direct acyclic graph of operations to run within RedisAI.

It accepts one or more operations, split by the pipe-forward operator (`|>`).

By default, the DAG execution context is local, meaning that tensor keys appearing in the DAG only live in the scope of the command. That is, setting a tensor with `TENSORSET` will store it local memory and not set it to an actual database key. One can refer to that key in subsequent commands within the DAG, but that key won't be visible outside the DAG or to other clients - no keys are open at the database level.

Loading and persisting tensors from/to keyspace should be done explicitly. The user should specify which key tensors to load from keyspace using the `LOAD` keyword, and which command outputs to persist to the keyspace using the `PERSIST` keyspace.

As an example, if `command 1` sets a tensor, it can be referenced by any further command on the chaining.


**Redis API**

```
AI.DAGRUN [LOAD <n> <key-1> <key-2> ... <key-n>]
          [PERSIST <n> <key-1> <key-2> ... <key-n>]
          |> <command> [|>  command ...]
```

_Arguments_

* **LOAD**: an optional argument, that denotes the beginning of the input tensors keys' list, followed by the number of keys, and one or more key names
* **PERSIST**: an optional argument, that denotes the beginning of the output tensors keys' list, followed by the number of keys, and one or more key names
* **|> command**: the chaining operator, that denotes the beginning of a RedisAI command, followed by one of RedisAI's commands. Command splitting is done by the presence of another `|>`. The supported commands are:
    * `AI.TENSORSET`
    * `AI.TENSORGET`
    * `AI.MODELRUN`
    * `AI.SCRIPTRUN`

`AI.MODELRUN` and `AI.SCRIPTRUN` commands can run on models or scripts that were set on different devices. RedisAI will analyze the DAG and execute commands in parallel if they are located on different devices and their inputs are available.

_Return_

An array with an entry per command's reply. Each entry format respects the specified command reply.

**Examples**

Assuming that running the model that's stored at 'mymodel', we define a temporary tensor 'mytensor' and use it as input, and persist only one of the two outputs - discarding 'classes' and persisting 'predictions'. In the same command return the tensor value of 'predictions'.  The following command does that:


```
redis> AI.DAGRUN PERSIST 1 predictions |>
          AI.TENSORSET mytensor FLOAT 1 2 VALUES 5 10 |>
          AI.MODELRUN mymodel INPUTS mytensor OUTPUTS classes predictions |>
          AI.TENSORGET predictions VALUES
1) OK
2) OK
3) 1) FLOAT
   2) 1) (integer) 2
      2) (integer) 2
   3) "\x00\x00\x80?\x00\x00\x00@\x00\x00@@\x00\x00\x80@"
```

A common pattern is enqueuing multiple SCRIPTRUN and MODELRUN commands within a DAG. The following example uses ResNet-50,to classify images into 1000 object categories. Given that our input tensor contains each color represented as a 8-bit integer and that neural networks usually work with floating-point tensors as their input we need to cast a tensor to floating-point and normalize the values of the pixels - for that we will use `pre_process_3ch` function. 

To optimize the classification process we can use a post process script to return only the category position with the maximum classification - for that we will use `post_process` script. Using the DAG capabilities we've removed the necessity of storing the intermediate tensors in the keyspace. You can even run the entire process without storing the output tensor, as follows:

```
redis> AI.DAGRUN_RO |> 
            AI.TENSORSET image UINT8 224 224 3 BLOB b'\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00....' |> 
            AI.SCRIPTRUN imagenet_script pre_process_3ch INPUTS image OUTPUTS temp_key1 |> 
            AI.MODELRUN imagenet_model INPUTS temp_key1 OUTPUTS temp_key2 |> 
            AI.SCRIPTRUN imagenet_script post_process INPUTS temp_key2 OUTPUTS output |> 
            AI.TENSORGET output VALUES
1) OK
2) OK
3) OK
4) OK
5) 1) 1) (integer) 111
```

As visible on the array reply, the label position with higher classification was 111. 

By combining DAG with multiple SCRIPTRUN and MODELRUN commands we've substantially removed the overall required bandwith and network RX ( we're now returning a tensor with 1000 times less elements per classification ).



!!! warning "Intermediate memory overhead"
    The execution of models and scripts within the DAG may generate intermediate tensors that are not allocated by the Redis allocator, but by whatever allocator is used in the backends (which may act on main memory or GPU memory, depending on the device), thus not being limited by `maxmemory` configuration settings of Redis.

## AI.DAGRUN_RO

The **`AI.DAGRUN_RO`** command is a read-only variant of `AI.DAGRUN`.

Because `AI.DAGRUN` provides the `PERSIST` option it is flagged as a 'write' command in the Redis command table. However, even when `PERSIST` isn't used, read-only cluster replicas will refuse tp run the command and it will be redirected to the master even if the connection is using read-only mode.

`AI.DAGRUN_RO` behaves exactly like the original command, excluding the `PERSIST` option. It is a read-only command that can safely be with read-only replicas.

!!! info "Further reference"
    Refer to the Redis [`READONLY` command](https://redis.io/commands/readonly) for further information about read-only cluster replicas.

## AI.INFO
The **`AI.INFO`** command returns information about the execution a model or a script.

Runtime information is collected each time that [`AI.MODELRUN`](#aimodelrun) or [`AI.SCRIPTRUN`](#aiscriptrun) is called. The information is stored locally by the executing RedisAI engine, so when deployed in a cluster each shard stores its own runtime information.

**Redis API**

```
AI.INFO <key> [RESETSTAT]
```

_Arguments_

* **key**: the key name of a model or script
* **RESETSTAT**: resets all statistics associated with the key

_Return_

An array with alternating entries that represent the following key-value pairs:

* **KEY**: a String of the name of the key storing the model or script value
* **TYPE**: a String of the type of value (i.e. 'MODEL' or 'SCRIPT')
* **BACKEND**: a String of the type of backend (always 'TORCH' for 'SCRIPT' value type)
* **DEVICE**: a String of the device where execution took place
* **DURATION**: the cumulative duration of executions in microseconds
* **SAMPLES**: the cumulative number of samples obtained from the 0th (batch) dimension (only applicable for RedisAI models)
* **CALLS**: the total number of executions
* **ERRORS**: the total number of errors generated by executions (excluding any errors generated during parsing commands)

When called with the `RESETSTAT` argument, the command returns a simple 'OK' string.

**Examples**

The following example obtains the previously-run 'myscript' script's runtime statistics:

```
redis> AI.INFO myscript
 1) key
 2) "myscript"
 3) type
 4) SCRIPT
 5) backend
 6) TORCH
 7) device
 8) CPU
 9) duration
10) (integer) 11391
11) samples
12) (integer) -1
13) calls
14) (integer) 1
15) errors
16) (integer) 0
```

The runtime statistics for that script can be reset like so:

```
redis> AI.INFO myscript RESETSTAT
OK
```

## AI.CONFIG
The **AI.CONFIG** command sets the value of configuration directives at run-time, and allows loading DL/ML backends dynamically.

!!! info "Loading DL/ML Backends at Bootstrap"
    Instead of loading your backends dynamically, you can have RedisAI load them during bootstrap. See the [Configuration page](configuration.md) for more information.

**Redis API**
```
AI.CONFIG <BACKENDSPATH <path>> | <LOADBACKEND <backend> <path>>
```

_Arguments_

* **BACKENDSPATH**: Specifies the default base backends path to `path`. The backends path is used when dynamically loading a backend (default: '{module_path}/backends', where `module_path` is the module's path).
* **LOADBACKEND**: Loads the DL/ML backend specified by the `backend` identifier from `path`. If `path` is relative, it is resolved by prefixing the `BACKENDSPATH` to it. If `path` is absolute then it is used as is. The `backend` can be one of:
    * **TF**: the TensorFlow backend
    * **TFLITE**: The TensorFlow Lite backend
    * **TORCH**: The PyTorch backend
    * **ONNX**: ONNXRuntime backend
* **MODEL_CHUNK_SIZE**: Sets the size of chunks (in bytes) in which model payloads are split for serialization, replication and `MODELGET`. Default is `511 * 1024 * 1024`.

_Return_

A simple 'OK' string or an error.

**Examples**

The following sets the default backends path to '/usr/lib/redis/modules/redisai/backends':

```
redis> AI.CONFIG BACKENDSPATH /usr/lib/redis/modules/redisai/backends
OK
```

This loads the PyTorch backend with a path relative to `BACKENDSPATH`:

```
redis> AI.CONFIG LOADBACKEND TORCH redisai_torch/redisai_torch.so
OK
```

This loads the PyTorch backend with a full path:

```
redis> AI.CONFIG LOADBACKEND TORCH /usr/lib/redis/modules/redisai/backends/redisai_torch/redisai_torch.so
OK
```

This sets model chunk size to one megabyte (not recommended):

```
redis> AI.CONFIG MODEL_CHUNK_SIZE 1048576
OK
```
