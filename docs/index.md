RedisAI is a Redis module for executing Deep Learning/Machine Learning models and managing their data. Its purpose is being a "workhorse" for model serving, by providing out-of-the-box support for popular DL/ML frameworks and unparalleled performance. **RedisAI both maximizes computation throughput and reduces latency by adhering to the principle of data locality**, as well as simplifies the deployment and serving of graphs by leveraging on Redis' production-proven infrastructure.

RedisAI is a joint effort between [Redis Labs](https://www.redislabs.com) and [Tensorwerk](https://tensorwerk.com).
