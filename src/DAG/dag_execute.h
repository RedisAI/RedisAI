/**
 @brief We are given a DAG runInfo of a sequence of operations, each with its own
 input and output keys. The names of the keys will be used to look whether the
 inputs to a DAG operation have all been realized by previous operations (or if
 they are available as part of LOADed keys from keyspace).
 This strategy is fine if keys are not aliased, that is, if a command's output
 overwrites the key of a previous command. This would trick DAG operations into
 thinking that their input is ready when it's not.
 To overcome this, we map the input and output tensors for every operation to indices,
 in the following way. For every input of an operation having the key "x", we map the index
 for which "x" was last mapped to when, it was an output of a previous operation.
 For every output of an operation "y", we map the next available index in the array.
 Every entry in the DAG array contains NULL (except for tensors that where loaded
 before the DAG run starts).
 @param rinfo The DAG runInfo.
 @param tensorsNamesToInd A dict mapping every key name of a tensor that appeared
 in DAG operation, to the maximal index of the DAG shared array for which they were mapped to.
 @returns REDISMODULE_ERR if there exists an operation for which one of the input
 tensors didn't appear as an output of a previous operation, REDISMODULE_OK otherwise
